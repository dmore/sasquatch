General

The project defaults to compiling in release mode, using a glviewport and
using gstreamer to directly generate thumbnails for video content

Requirements

Qt > 4.7.1
Qt Mobility

Compiling

qmake
make

QML

It appears you have to use: forceActiveFocus to change focus if no item currently has active focus

Qt.createComponent does not appear to be cognizant of import calls in said file

Can't query/discover path of QML file being run (making it impossible to use generic qmlviewer for skin work)
