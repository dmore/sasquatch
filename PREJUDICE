A large component of the dev team runs on Arch Linux; this should run well
on any modern X11 based Linux platform, and we are actively in the process
of testing/adjusting Qt Media Hub to run fantastically independently of
X11.

Qt Media Hub is also tested with regularity on Mac OS 10.6 (with ports
supplying all the deps, pkg-config carrying the load and XCode 4 doing the
real heavy lifting)
