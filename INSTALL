QtMediaHub requires:
  * Qt >= 4.7.4 (2ba170cfdcfa8166b78bc2dbfa7ca5c402b13a29) qt/4.7 branch
  * Qt Mobility (d6e95b299abc37682ce9d4b3050805abb9ad91df) master branch
  * Qt 3D (129ed97e821af5db686c7f109762ffc7a4151250) master branch

The core engine, skins and resources are placed in separate respositories.

Core engine - This contains the backend and the launcher. Available at 
git@gitorious.org:qtmediahub/qtmediahub-core.git

Resources - This contains resource files. For example, programs that may appear
in the Dashboard etc. Available at git@gitorious.org:qtmediahub/resources.git

Skins - Skins control the look and feel of Qt Media Hub. They tend to be quite large
to clone since they contains lots of images and hence are stored as separate repositories.
  * Confluence skin (suitable for home TV) - git@gitorious.org:qtmediahub/confluence.git
  * Rapid skin (suitable for IVI) - git@gitorious.org:qtmediahub/rapid.git
  * Delphin  - git@gitorious.org:qtmediahub/delphin.git

You need at least one skin checked out to have a functional QtMediaHub.

Skins are automatically searched for in the following locations:

/usr/share/qtmediahub/skins/
$HOME/.qtmediahub/skins

and you can add additional scanning paths with either the QMH_SKINPATH env
var or the -skins <folder> command line option.

Checking out the code:
1. git clone git@gitorious.org:qtmediahub/qtmediahub-core.git

hub/ is like the install folder. After building QtMediaHub, you can just copy over hub/ to
whatever device.

2. cd hub
3. git clone git@gitorious.org:qtmediahub/resources.git (so the path is hub/resources)

hub/skins/ stores the skins
4. mkdir skins && cd skins
5. git clone git@gitorious.org:qtmediahub/confluence.git (or any other skin)

Building:
1. qmake (in the top level)
2. make
3. ./hub/qtmediahub

Options:

 -keymap <keymap>
 -last-skin <skin>
 -plugins <folder>
 -resources <folder>
 -skins <folder>
