QtMediaHub requires:

:Qt:

We maintain a known functional Qt 4.7 branch qmh-qt-4.7-baseline which
resides at:

https://qt.gitorious.org/+mediatrolls/qt/dcarrs-qt

This branch tracks Qt 4.7 with additional:

1) Bug workarounds
2) Backported patches from Qt 4.8

it should be very close to Qt 4.7 head. It is tested and known to work
against Qt Media Hub. (You should always be able to track it)

1) git clone git@gitorious.org:+mediatrolls/qt/dcarrs-qt.git qmh-qt
2) cd qmh-qt
3) git checkout qmh-qt-4.7-baseline
4) ./configure -foo .......
5) make (&& make install)

:Qt Mobility:

We have a hard requirement of Qt Multimedia which exists as part of the Qt
Mobility project.

1) git clone git@gitorious.org:qt-mobility/qt-mobility.git
2) cd qt-mobility
3) ./configure -prefix $sameAsQtPrefix -modules "multimedia" -foo ........
4) make (&& make install)

Certain plugins also make use of the "location" and "systeminfo" modules,
but these are optional dependencies
